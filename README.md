# alpha-research
My project from Udacity's Nanodegree "AI for Trading" where I build multifactor model seeking alpha and optamize asset portfolio.
The repo contains my notebook I used to research alpha using multifactor modelling and used PCA to optimize my portfolio. It also contains tests.py script used to test my code. Also, project_helper.py was created by Udacity's course team to include functions I used for my project. It also has requirement.txt file to download libraries on which this project is dependent on.
